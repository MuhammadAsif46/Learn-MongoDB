## Interview Questions:

- What is MongoDB, and how is it different from a relational database?

**Answer**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data
in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for schema-
less data storage. Unlike relational databases, which use
tables and rows, MongoDB uses collections and
documents. This allows for more flexible and scalable
data models.

- Explain the structure of a MongoDB document. What are its key components?

**Answer**: A MongoDB document is a BSON (Binary JSON)
object that consists of field-value pairs. The key
components include fields (which are similar to columns in
relational databases) and values (which can be of various
data types, such as strings, numbers, arrays, or even nested
documents).


- What are the advantages of using MongoDB over traditional RDBMS systems?

**Answer**: Advantages include:
- Flexibility in schema design.
- Horizontal scalability via sharding.
- High availability through replica sets.
- Easier to manage unstructured or semi-structured data.
- Rich querying and aggregation capabilities.

- How does MongoDB store data? Explain the concept of collections and documents.

**Answer**: MongoDB stores data in BSON format within
documents. These documents are grouped into collections,
which are analogous to tables in relational databases. Each
document within a collection can have a different structure,
allowing for flexible data modeling.
